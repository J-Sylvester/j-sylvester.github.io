  <h3>Pete Austin - <i>Parity Games on Temporal Graphs</i></h3>

    <p>Temporal graphs are a popular modelling mechanism for dynamic complex systems that extend ordinary graphs with discrete time. Simply put, time progresses one unit per step and the availability of edges can change with time.</p>

        <p>We consider the complexity of solving ω-regular games played on temporal graphs where the edge availability is ultimately periodic and fixed a priori.</p>

        <p>We show that solving parity games on temporal graphs is decidable in PSPACE, only assuming the edge predicate itself is in PSPACE. A matching lower bound already holds for what we call punctual reachability games on static graphs, where one player wants to reach the target at a given, binary encoded, point in time. We further study syntactic restrictions that imply more efficient procedures. In particular, if the edge predicate is in P and is monotonically increasing for one player and decreasing for the other, then the complexity of solving games is only polynomially increased compared to static graphs.</p>

<h3>Andreas Goebel - <i>The Impact of Heterogeneity and Geometry on the Proof Complexity
of Random Satisfiability</i> </h3>



<p> Satisfiability is considered the canonical NP-complete problem
and is used as a starting point for hardness reductions in theory, while
in practice heuristic SAT solving algorithms can solve large-scale
industrial SAT instances very efficiently. This disparity between theory
and practice is believed to be a result of inherent properties of
industrial SAT instances that make them tractable. Two characteristic
properties seem to be prevalent in the majority of real-world SAT
instances, heterogeneous degree distribution and locality. To understand
the impact of these two properties on SAT, we study the proof complexity
of random k-SAT models that allow to control heterogeneity and locality.
Our findings show that heterogeneity alone does not make SAT easy as
heterogeneous random k-SAT instances have superpolynomial resolution
size. This implies intractability of these instances for modern
SAT-solvers. On the other hand, modeling locality with an underlying
geometry leads to small unsatisfiable subformulas, which can be found
within polynomial time. </p>

<p>in the complexity of higher-order Voronoi diagrams. As an additional
technical contribution, we show a linear upper bound on the number of
non-empty Voronoi regions, that holds for points with random positions
in a very general setting. In particular, it covers arbitrary p-norms,
higher dimensions, and weights affecting the area of influence of each
point multiplicatively. This is in stark contrast to quadratic lower
bounds for the worst case.  </p>

<h3>Nicolas Klodt -  <i>Analysis of the survival time of the SIRS process via expansion</i>
</h3>


<p>We study the SIRS process, a continuous-time Markov chain modeling the spread of infections on graphs. In this model, vertices are either susceptible, infected, or recovered. Each infected vertex becomes recovered at rate $1$ and infects each of its susceptible neighbors independently at rate $\lambda$, and each recovered vertex becomes susceptible at a rate $\rho$, which we assume to be independent of the graph size. A central quantity of the SIRS process is the time until no vertex is infected, known as the survival time. Surprisingly though, rigorous theoretical results exist only for the related SIS model so far.</p>
<p>We address this imbalance by conducting theoretical analyses of the SIRS process via their expansion properties. We prove that the expected survival time of the SIRS process on stars is at most polynomial in the graph size for any value of $\lambda$. This behavior is fundamentally different from the SIS process, where the expected survival time is exponential already for small infection rates.</p>
<p>Our main result is an exponential lower bound of the expected survival time of the SIRS process on expander graphs. Specifically, we show that on expander graphs $G$ with $n$ vertices, degree close to $d$, and sufficiently small spectral expansion, the SIRS process has expected survival time at least exponential in $n$ when $\lambda\geq c/d$ for a constant $c>1$. Previous results on the SIS process show that this bound is almost tight. Additionally, our result holds even if $G$ is a subgraph. Notably, our result implies an almost-tight threshold for Erdos-Rényi graphs and a regime of exponential survival time for hyperbolic random graphs. The proof of our main result draws inspiration from Lyapunov functions used in mean-field theory to devise a two-dimensional potential function and applying a negative-drift theorem to show that the expected survival time is exponential.</p>

<h3>Viktor Zamaraev - <i>Giant Components in Random Temporal Graphs</i></h3>

<p>A temporal graph is a graph whose edges appear only at certain points in time. In this work, we consider a temporal analog of the Erdos-Renyi random graph model. The proposed model is obtained by randomly permuting the edges of an Erdos-Renyi random graph and interpreting this permutation as an ordering of presence times. It was shown recently that the connectivity threshold in the Erdos-Renyi model fans out into multiple phase transitions for several distinct notions of reachability in the temporal setting. </p>



<p>In the present work, we identify a sharp threshold for the emergence of a giant temporally connected component. We show that at p = log(n)/n the size of the largest temporally connected component increases from o(n) to n-o(n). This threshold holds for both open and closed connected components, i.e., components that allow, respectively forbid, their connecting paths to use external nodes.<p/>

        <h3>John Sylvester - <i> Rumors with Changing Credibility </i> </h3>
        <p>Randomized rumor spreading processes diffuse information on an undirected graph and have been widely studied. In this work, we present a generic framework for analyzing a broad class of such processes on regular graphs. Our analysis is protocol-agnostic, as it only requires the expected proportion of newly informed vertices in each round to be bounded, and a natural negative correlation property.</p>

       <p>This framework allows us to analyze various protocols, including PUSH, PULL, and PUSH-PULL, thereby extending prior research. Unlike previous work, our framework accommodates message failures at any time $t\geq 0$ with a probability of $1 − q(t)$, where the credibility $q(t)$ is any function of time. This enables us to model real-world scenarios in which the transmissibility of rumors may fluctuate, as seen in the spread of “fake news” and viruses. Additionally, our framework is sufficiently broad to cover dynamic graphs, provided they are regular at each time-step.</p>
