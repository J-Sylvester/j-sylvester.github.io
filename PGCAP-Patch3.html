           <h3>Introduction</h3>



           <p>Computer Science (CS) is a broad church, and a typical undergraduate computer science curriculum in the UK tries to cover as many facets of the subject as possible. The aim of this is to give students a broad view of computer science while giving them enough practical knowledge to be successful in industry. One upshot of this is that CS students often do not cover as much content in Theoretical Computer Science (TCS), and it is something they typically struggle with. This is compounded by the fact that a typical CS student does not take so many courses with a high mathematical content, meaning that they often lack the mathematical maturity needed to solve problems in TCS independently.
           </p>

           <p>This does not mean we should give up trying to teach topics in TCS, and in this blog I will outline some practices and tools which are useful in delivering a successful course in TCS to UK university students.
           </p>

 <br>


      <h3>1. Provide clear detailed slides, preferably also lecture notes </h3>

      <div class="imageflex">
        <p class="imageflexcontent">This first point is the most obvious but arguably the most important. A learning outcome of a theory course is that the students should understand and analyse algorithms and models, this is difficult if the algorithm/model is not clearly described in the course material. Slides are the primary method of content delivery in Computer Science, this has advantages and disadvantages. The main disadvantage is that long proofs have to either be summarised/simplified or broken over several slides. The former degrades the quality of slides as a learning resource, which is not ideal if they are the primary resource. The second option has serious impacts for engagement during lectures. The current set of (inherited) slides on my course is optimised for lecturing, and not for use as a primary text. The idea is that the students should refer to one of the course textbooks for a more formal treatment of the material, however the average student will not refer to a textbook, and will just rely on the slides.
        </p>

      </div>
  <p>A potential solution is to also produce lecture notes. I am currently working on revamping the slides (converting them from ppt to beamer) and although my initial thought was to make them more complete/detailed, I am moving towards keeping them roughly as they are and producing a set of lecture notes alongside them. These notes contain only what is in the course (just in more detail). My hope that as the notes will be written by me, the students will see them as directly relevant to passing the course, and will find them more accessible than a larger and more general textbook.
              </p>
              <br>



            <h3>2. Giving well explained solutions to problems</h3>


            <p>There is always a question of whether to use tutorial time to get the students to solve problems/exercises themselves, or to show them (hands on) how to solve problems. In teaching theoretical courses this is particularly pertinent. I have found that doing the latter is more successful, as often students do not actually know how to solve such problems as they have solved many theory exercises before.
            </p>
            <p> There are some experimental trials which support the idea that problem-solving is best taught though example rather than practice. In experiments run by <a class="simple" href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3233555" target="_blank">Sweller and Cooper</a>, two groups were shown how to solve two algebra exercises. The first group was then shown how to solve a further eight exercises, and the second group was given a set of eight exercises to solve themselves. After this both groups were given a further set of exercises and it was found that the first group were more proficient (faster and more accurate) at solving this final set than the second set.</p>

            <h3>3. Use of examples in animations, videos, and other formats</h3>
<p>
  The slides I currently use have lots of animations showing examples of an algorithm running on a specific input. I think these work very well in helping the students understand the algorithms as often pseudocode is quite hard to understand, and it is easier to read once you have an idea of what the algorithm is actually doing. The downside of these animations/examples is that they take up time in the lecture and also do not translate well to printed out slides.
  </p>
  <p> Something I will try next year is getting the students to actually run the algorithms themselves (on paper) during the lecture. The hope is that this hands on practical approach will work well with certain types of learners, and the activity will act as a `reset' to the students attention during lecture. </p>

  <p>I will also include hyperlinks to relevant YouTube videos on topics covered in the lectures. The hope is that these videos will potentially offer a higher quality of animation than I can produce within the slides, especially outside of the lecture, and also offer an alternative perspective to me or the textbook. Some channels that produce very good quality videos that may be relevant to TCS <a class="simple" href="https://www.youtube.com/@Computerphile" target="_blank">Computerphile</a>, and <a class="simple" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8jsijhllIA" target="_blank">3Blue1Brown</a>. Here is an example of a YouTube video with a nice visualisation:</p>

  <p>There are also several websites with animations for certain algorithms such as  <a class="simple" href="https://www.toptal.com/developers/sorting-algorithms" target="_blank">Toptal</a>.</p>



<br>
            <h3>4. Online tools such as polls and anonymous forums </h3>

            <p>Online polling tools allow teachers to pose questions to students and instantly view and display the results. They can be used to assess prior knowledge, identify areas needing further attention, review topics for better knowledge retention, ask informal questions to start a class, conduct formative assessments, gather student opinions, or check their understanding of a subject. Examples of online polling tools are <a class="simple" href="https://pollev.com" target="_blank">Poll Everywhere</a>, <a class="simple" href="https://kahoot.com" target="_blank">Kahoot</a>, and <a class="simple" href="https://www.menti.com/" target="_blank">Mentimeter</a>. I intend to use polls during lectures when my course resumes next semester, here is a screen shot of a poll I created on Poll Everywhere:   </p>


                    <img height = 400px src="/home/john/Documents/PGCAP/Patch 3/PollEv.png" alt="Poll">
            <p> Another online tool that is very useful are anonymous message boards, one I am familiar with is <a class="simple" href="https://campuswire.com" target="_blank">Campuswire</a>. This allows students to ask questions anonymously which can answered by the lecturer or other students. The anonymity means that "no question is too dumb" and the hope is that this encourages students to ask questions that they would not have felt comfortable asking otherwise. Also the questions, and my replies, are fixed on the board so that other students can also see them and so benefit from this. I have had good success with this in the past two years and below is a screen shot from the Campuswire page for my course last year.

        <h3>5. Clear guidence on assessments and structured questions</h3>

        <p> Given  that a lot of students will be unlikely to have covered much material on TCS before your course, they will likely not be so familiar with solving problems in TCS. For this reason it is important that problems are stated very clearly, in particularly in assessed problem sheets and exams. This is also important as CS courses typically attract a high proportion of international students who may not be so proficient in the English language. If introducing a computational problem in an exam or homework sheet, which the students have not seen in lectures, I normally make sure to include an example instance of the problem with an optimal solution to that specific instance. This way the students at least understand the problem before I ask them some question about finding solutions to the problem more generally.</p>
        <p>When setting questions it is quite important how the question is structured and it is often advisable to break a single task into a series of smaller parts to make it more approachable. If the solution to a question requires several different steps and it is just posed as a single question, then it is quite likely that a student will not even start the question unless they have a clear idea of how to solve the whole thing. Perhaps this is fine as you want some questions that only the best can answer, however if you gauge it wrongly and nobody answers it then you have wasted a question. If you repeatedly ask large single question which are bookwork, then the students will spot these patterns from previous years and be encouraged to just learn large proofs by wrote, this is a bad outcome.  Generally I think it is better to break questions into smaller parts which guide the student, even if this is to show something “seen” then the student might not just pattern match the statement to be proved and it will force them to breakdown their answer to fit the individual questions asked, this is more likely to show up a misunderstanding of the student.  </p>

            <h3>Conclusions </h3>
<p> Teaching Theoretical Computer Science (TCS) to UK university students presents unique challenges, particularly due to its abstract nature and the students' varying levels of mathematical maturity. However, by implementing clear and structured teaching methods, such as providing detailed lecture notes, walking through problem-solving examples, utilizing engaging animations and online tools, and offering well-guided assessments, educators can significantly improve students' understanding and retention of TCS concepts. These practices not only enhance enguagement but should hopefully also help students gain a deeper understanding of the topic. </p>
